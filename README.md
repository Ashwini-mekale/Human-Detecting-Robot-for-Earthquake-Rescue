# Human-Detecting-Robot-for-Earthquake-Rescue
# INTRODUCTION 
A  new approach  for detecting  humans in  destructed environments  using  a autonomous  robot  is  proposed.
Human  body  detection  system  proposed  a monitoring system  using sensors  and  camera  to capture, transmit  and  analyze conditions of human body.
 In order  to detect a human body , an autonomous robot must be equipped  with a specific  set of sensors  that provide  information about  the presence of a person  in the environment  around.
Every year, various collapses of man-made structures such as bridges, buildings and also natural catastrophes like earthquake, landslides occur in various parts of the world. 
This  system  has the  potential  to achieve high  performance in detecting   humans in  devastated  environments  relatively quickly  and cost-effectively.
The Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) says, the probability of saving a victim is high only within the first 40hrs of rescue operation, and then the probability becomes zero. In such cases, humans are being trapped in the cavities created by collapsed building either in conscious or unconscious state.
Disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
